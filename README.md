Subject: Request for Extension on Task Delivery

Dear Internal Success Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that due to a sudden family emergency,
 I will not be able to meet the original due date for the task tomorrow.

I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, and I regret having to request an extension. 
I am seeking an extension of three days to allow me to deal with the emergency and complete the task to the best of my ability.

I would like to assure you that I am fully committed to completing the task to a high standard and within the extended timeline. 
I appreciate your understanding and look forward to your prompt response.

If you require any further information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Atul Kumar Panigrahi
